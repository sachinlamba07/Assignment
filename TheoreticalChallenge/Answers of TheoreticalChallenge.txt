Question 1 :- How will you tackle the challenge above?

Ans :-   Reading CSV Data:-

           -> Read the CSV file line by line.
           -> Split each line to extract cell names and values.
           -> Add a HashMap with cell names and their corresponding values or formulas.


         Evaluating Formulas:

            ->Iterate through the HashMap entries.
            ->If a cell value starts with "=", it indicates a formula.
            ->Use a recursive function to evaluate the formula, considering dependencies on other cells.


          Write the final results to an output CSV file.


Question 2 :- What type of errors you would you check for?

Ans :-       CSV Parsing :-

                -> Check for the correct format of the CSV input.

             Formula Evaluation:-

                -> Prevent infinite recursion.
                -> Validate arithmetic operations.

Question 3 :- How might a user break your code?

Ans :-        Users might break the code by providing CSV files with incorrect formatting
              CSV files with incorrect or unexpected characters.
